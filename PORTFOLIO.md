## Overview

AI Income Planner is a beautiful, bilingual income planning tool designed for freelancers and consultants. It provides real-time income calculations, multi-scenario forecasting, and interactive visualizations to help independent professionals make informed business decisions.

Built with Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, and modern web technologies, it demonstrates professional-grade architecture, design system discipline, and attention to user experience.

## The Challenge

Freelancers and consultants face income planning challenges:

- **Manual calculations** are time-consuming and error-prone
- **Single-scenario thinking** doesn't account for market volatility
- **Lack of visualization** makes it hard to understand seasonal patterns
- **Language barriers** limit accessibility for bilingual professionals
- **No persistence** means recalculating every time

These issues lead to poor financial planning and missed opportunities.

- Monthly projections with interactive charts
- Seasonal pattern modeling
- Range visualization for income variability

**Localization & Persistence:**

- Complete EN/ES translation system
- Currency formatting (MXN/USD)
- localStorage state persistence
- Theme switching (light/dark)

## Technical Highlights

- **Next.js 14 App Router:** Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
- **TypeScript:** Strict typing throughout, no `any` types
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first styling with custom design system
- **Zustand:** Lightweight state management with persist middleware
